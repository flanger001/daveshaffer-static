# David Shaffer personal website code

Feel free to fork this repository.
I offer no support on this, however, on account of the fact that if you both know how and are motivated to clone a repository, you can divine how to use the code inside it.
I license the code with WTFPL license because it is both funny and good.
However, that does mean that under the license, you are free to do what the fuck you want to with it.
I humbly ask that if you do fork this repository and deploy it yourself, please delete any of my specific posts.
That would just be weird otherwise, right?
